    - title: AI Binary Analysis
      description:
        - Developing a Transformer-based automated binary code analysis tool that can directly recover architectural information, function boundaries, and compiler/optimization option information from the Byte Code level. It achieves over 99% accuracy on more than 50 architectures, significantly outperforming previous traditional ML-based methods.
    
    - title: Connected Vehicle Security Testing
      description:
        - Conducting reverse analysis and penetration testing on the official apps of certain vehicle models. This has helped the team discover and validate numerous security vulnerabilities, including unencrypted critical information in the Bluetooth Low Energy vehicle control protocol within the code, extractable and reversible encryption algorithms, and untimely key updates.
   
    - title: LLM Evaluation Framework
      description:
        - Designing the latest large model security capability evaluation framework, <a href="https://secbench.org/">SecBench</a>, in which contributions include the macro design of the evaluation framework, specific evaluation set data collection and cleaning, automated evaluation process development, and related data challenge competition evaluation rules, participant data scoring, and subsequent data cleaning. Compared to existing work, SecBench has the largest number of questions and the most comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and it is also the first framework to directly support numerous security exams and subjective question assessments.
