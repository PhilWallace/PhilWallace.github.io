Iâ€™m Pengfei Jing, currently a PhD candidate in the department of computing (COMP), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/'>Xiapu Luo</a>. My research interests include the security and testing of modern vehicles and autonomous driving systems (ADS), AI-assisted program analysis, LLM implementations, etc.

Additionally, I have been working closely with the Tencent Keen Lab during my PhD career, supervised under Tecent Security Researcher Sen Nie. We are currently exploring areas including ADS testing and LLM-assisted program analysis.
